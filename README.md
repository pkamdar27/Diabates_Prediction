# Diabates_Prediction
This is Web Application to predict whether an individual has Diabetes or not

Diabetes Dataset is extracted from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The main objective of this dataset is to predict whether a person has the diabetes or not.
There are certain criteria which user/person has to input to get the Test Result. Below are the details:-
Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function
Age: Age (years)
Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1)

For this dataset, I have done data analysis and visualization. Data visualization is done with seaborn, matplotlit, plotly and profile report.Have also explored Machine learning algorithm and done comparison to check which algorithm gives us the good accuracy rate. The 5 algorithms were Logistic regression, Random Forest Classifier, KNeighbors Classifier, SVC and GaussianNB. Further, have built an web application with streamlit where user can input the data and get the Test result, whether a person is Diabetic or not.
